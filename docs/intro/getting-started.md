# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

People that are not familiar with the command line or editing configuration files should learn that first or pass their way.
You also need [**Node.js (including npm)**](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
Once Node.js installed and configured (both `node` and `npm` should be available through the PATH), you must install the **cli** tool.

```bash
npm i -g @efc/cli
```
