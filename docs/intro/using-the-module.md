## Creating a new project folder
After the installation of the module using the `npm` command, a new command is registered inside your terminal: `cyn`

To create a new project symply type:

```sh
$ cyn new myproject
```

It will create a new folder called `myproject` with some basic files. The architecture of the folder is described in the next chapter.
You can go directly to your project by typing 
```sh
cd myproject
```
