# Using the module

The module is extremely easy to use:
- It's interactive
- No complex flags to pass to the cli
- Adapt to its environment
- **Cross-Platform**
 
All the following demonstrations will be made using cmder on Windows 10

## Creating a new project folder
After the installation of the module using the `npm` command, a new command is registered inside your terminal: `efc`

Try it now by yourself:
- Open your preferred command prompt tool (e.g. run CMD on Windows)
- Type `efc` and press enter
- A menu will open up where you can press up and down to select an option. Select **Create a New Project** and press `ENTER`
- Type your project's name and press `ENTER` to create it's folder
- **use git**: If true, this option will generate a standard .gitignore file that excludes common folders from the electron project
- **include standalone preview tool**: The standlaone preview is an executable that allow you to preview your electron project without using the cli (since Construct 2 or Steam only accepts .exe files)

After you're done, a new folder will be created with some basic files. You can go directly to it by typing `cd` and the folder name. 

Now you can either [configure your project options](/configuration/general.html) or [build your game](/build/building.html).

::: tip Tip from the official documentation

" The game is no longer available from the provided URL as soon as you close the Remote Preview dialog. You can open the Remote Preview dialog to its own window to help keep it out of the way, by right-clicking on its caption and selecting Open to popup window. "
